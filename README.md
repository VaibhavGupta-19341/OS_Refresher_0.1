# OS_Refresher_0.1

The task is write out a simple C program â€“ hello.c, that would have two local variables intialised to some values. 
Thereafter, print them out via printf() function and exit the program. 
Next, use gcc compiler to walk through all the steps of compilation. The first step would be to pause at the pre-processing step. 
Explain the output of the pre-processing, based on the output file (derived by pausing the compilation at the preprocessing step). 
Thereafter, you need go via all the compilation steps and pause at each step, save the output file and explain the contents in each of these output files.
